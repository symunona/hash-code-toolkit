### HashCodeToolkit

This is a little framework to make our chances better. 

This tool is to reduce the time spent on operative stuff, so we have more time to actually try the algorithms we come up with.

### What it does

- Manages, parses and caches inputs
- Manages solver algorithms and their versions and magic constants used in there
- Provides a scoreboard to see how they are doing
- Provides an interface to compare and graph input and results
- Caches algorithm outputs for input data sets, so they are easily exportable
- Packs the output data & code

### How to use it

Create a new project folder by copying the stub.

Set parameters in launch.json (we use VSCode)

Run your solution.
